## Next Steps
- Music player/display gets in the way on the mobile version 
- Music will play over top of eachother if you are on the Random page and try to play two tracks at once
- Generate a random artist that is not based on your current taste, maybe also based on genre
- If searching get rid of highlighted link in sidebar
- Save an artist to a list
- Save tracks to a playlist
- Better error handling
- Dark mode could be cool
- Fix repeating components, make one
- Filter by genre
- Following doesn't show all artists, randomize page on each request
